# Terraform module for GitLab auto scaling runners on Spot instances
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lean-delivery/tf-module-aws-gitlab-runner.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lean-delivery/tf-module-aws-gitlab-runner)

## Description
This repo contains a terraform module to run a [GitLab CI multi runner](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/) on AWS Spot instances. See the blog post at [040code](https://040code.github.io/2017/12/09/runners-on-the-spot/) for a detailed description of the setup.

The setup is based on the blog post: [Auto scale GitLab CI runners and save 90% on EC2 costs](https://about.gitlab.com/2017/11/23/autoscale-ci-runners/) The created runner will have by default a shared cache in S3 and logging is streamed to CloudWatch. The cache in S3 will expire in X days, see configuration. The logging can be disabled.

### AWS
To run the terraform scripts you need to have AWS keys.
Example file:

```sh
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
```

### Service linked roles
The gitlab runner ec2 instance needs the following sercice linked roles:

- AWSServiceRoleForAutoScaling
- AWSServiceRoleForEC2Spot

By default the ec2 instance is allowed to create the roles, by setting the option `allow_iam_service_linked_role_creation` to `false` you can deny the creation of roles by the instance. In that case you have to ensure the roles exists. You can create them manually or via terraform.

```hcl
resource "aws_iam_service_linked_role" "spot" {
  aws_service_name = "spot.amazonaws.com"
}

resource "aws_iam_service_linked_role" "autoscaling" {
  aws_service_name = "autoscaling.amazonaws.com"
}
```

### Workers linked role
Empty role will be created.
```hcl
resource "aws_iam_role" "runner" {
  name = "${var.environment}-runner-role"

  #The policy that grants an entity permission to assume the role
  assume_role_policy = "${data.template_file.instance_role_trust_policy.rendered}"
}

resource "aws_iam_instance_profile" "runner" {
  name = "${var.environment}-runner-profile"
  role = "${aws_iam_role.runner.name}"
}
```

This role will be passed as an argument to
docker-machine aws cloud provider driver (--amazonec2-iam-instance-profile please refer to [docker-machine aws driver docs](https://docs.docker.com/machine/drivers/aws/)
for more detailed info) and docker hosts will be spawned with it. You can refer to this role via
module output and  attach all required policies for your workflow


## Usage

### Conditional creation
```hcl
 module "gitlab-runner" {
  source = "git::https://github.com/lean-delivery/tf-module-aws-gitlab-runner.git"

  aws_region     = "${var.aws_region}"
  environment    = "${var.environment}"
  ssh_public_key = "${file("${var.ssh_key_file}")}"

  vpc_id                    = "${module.vpc.vpc_id}"
  subnet_id_gitlab_runner   = "${element(module.vpc.private_subnets, 0)}"
  subnet_id_runners         = "${element(module.vpc.private_subnets, 0)}"
  availability_zone_runners = "${var.availability_zone_runners}"

  # Values below are created during the registration process of the runner.
  runners_name       = "${var.runner_name}"
  runners_gitlab_url = "https://gitlab.com/"
  runners_token      = "token"

  runners_off_peak_periods = "* * * * * sat,sun *"
}
```
